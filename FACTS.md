- kinda like platform but not that much into the CMS and more about enablement of other teams
- how to make better pages, faster pages, more accessible pages (how to bake it into SDK)
- we want tighter control over how users navigate the site

  - use react component in OXP modules
  - make CD-API return CMS managed pages data
  - rebuild pages from scratch and ignore what's managed through CMS
